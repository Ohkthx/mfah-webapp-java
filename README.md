## Configuration

Environment variables used to start the HTTP server and give access to database located in `app.config`. Copy `app.config-sample` to `app.config` and make your edits. This needs to be updated to fit your environment. Be sure to load the database with the following two sources. Be sure to report any changes regarding the schema.

- [database_template.sql](https://github.com/Ohkthx/mfah-webapp-java/blob/main/database_template.sql), updated schema for the database.
- [database-data.sql](https://github.com/Ohkthx/mfah-webapp-java/blob/main/database-data.sql), basic data to make login portal functional. View in my depth to see login credentials.

## Building

Using Maven. Personally used Maven plugins in GitHub to compile and run the server.
